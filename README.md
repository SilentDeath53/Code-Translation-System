# Code Translation System
This project requires advanced knowledge in multiple programming languages, a deep understanding of the specific syntax, semantics, and underlying concepts of each language (or the languages to be added), and familiarity with the rules and logic unique to each language. It also requires a thorough understanding of the syntax and semantic rules for the translation rules, and a comprehensive set of tests to ensure the translation engine works efficiently and accurately (with a robust error-handling mechanism).


Due to the time constraints and the complexity and intricacy of the project, I currently do not have sufficient time to dedicate to it. Therefore, I will temporarily set this project as a "ToDo" item. However, I have provided an example C++ code snippet above that demonstrates the conversion of Python code to C++. This can serve as a starting point and provide some insights into the logic for those who are interested in pursuing such a project.

@Update:

- Added a code sample that allows you to convert the Javascript code.

Keep in mind that this is a simple infrastructure, it needs more progress to be efficient and smooth. Free to ask & use.
